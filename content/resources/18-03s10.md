  caption: A spring system responds to being shaken by oscillating. When the input
    frequency is near a natural mode of the system, the amplitude is large. This can
    be understood in the frequency domain using the Laplace transform and its pole
    diagram. (Image courtesy Hu Hohn and Prof. Haynes Miller.)
